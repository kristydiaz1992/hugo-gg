<h3><strong>The basics of denture relining: what it is and why you might need it</strong></h3>
<p>If you wear dentures, you may eventually need denture relining. This is a process whereby the fit of your dentures is improved by adding new material to the base of them. Dentures naturally change shape over time as they are worn, so relining them helps to ensure a snug and comfortable fit.</p>

<p>There are two main types of denture relining: hard relining and soft relining. Hard relining involves adding a hard material, such as acrylic, to the base of your dentures. This type of relining is typically used when there is a significant change in the shape of your mouth, such as after tooth loss.</p>
<p>Soft relining, on the other hand, uses a soft material, such as silicone, to line the base of your dentures. This type of relining is usually recommended for people who have minor changes in the shape of their mouth or who are experiencing discomfort with their dentures.</p>
<p>If you think you might need denture relining, the first step is to consult with your dentist. They will be able to assess the fit of your dentures and make a recommendation as to which type of relining would be best for you.</p>
<p>Once you have decided to go ahead with relining, the dentist will take an impression of your mouth, which will be used to create your new denture base. The relining process usually takes around two weeks and once it is complete, you will be able to enjoy your newly fitted dentures.</p>
<h3><br /><strong>The different types of relines available</strong></h3>
<p>When getting a denture, you have the option of getting a regular denture or a reline. A reline is when the dentist takes an impression of your mouth and relines the denture so that it fits snugly against your gums. There are three different types of relines: hard, soft, and immediate.</p>
<p>A hard reline is when the dentist uses a hard material to reline the denture. This type of reline is usually done if you have a lot of wear on your denture or if your gums have changed shape. A hard reline can last for up to five years.</p>
<p>A soft reline is when the dentist uses a soft material to reline the denture. This type of reline is usually done if you have slight wear on your denture or if your gums have changed shape. A soft reline can last for up to two years.</p>
<p>An immediate reline is when the dentist uses a hard or soft material to reline the denture right after it is made. This type of reline is usually done if you have had extractions or if your gums have changed shape. An immediate reline can last for six months to a year.</p>
<p>A smile is one of the first things that people notice about you, and a beautiful smile can light up a room. However, not everyone is blessed with perfect teeth. That's where <a href="https://dentures.vercel.app/posts/dazzling-new-smile/">cosmetic dentistry</a> comes in.

<h3><br />The process of getting a reline</h3>
<p>The process of getting a reline is simple and easy. First, you need to find a qualified dentist who offers this service. Once you've found a dentist, you need to make an appointment for a consultation. During the consultation, the dentist will examine your teeth and discuss the best options for your particular case. In most cases, the dentist will recommend a traditional denture reline.</p>
<p>A traditional denture reline involves taking an impression of your teeth. This impression is used to create a custom-fitted reline. The reline is then placed over your existing denture, and the two are bonded together. This type of reline is usually more comfortable and durable than a one-size-fits-all reline.</p>
<p>If you have a partial denture, you may be able to get a partial reline. A partial reline replaces only the portion of your denture that rests on your gums. This can be a good option if you only need a small adjustment to your denture.</p>
<p>Once you've decided on the type of reline you want, the dentist will take another impression of your teeth. This impression is used to create the new reline. The reline is then placed over your existing denture and bonded in place.</p>
<p>After the reline is in place, you'll need to wait a few weeks for it to adjust to your mouth. During this time, you may experience some discomfort and soreness. However, this is normal and will go away as your mouth adjusts to the new reline.</p>
<p>If you take care of your reline and practice good oral hygiene, it can last for many years.</p>
